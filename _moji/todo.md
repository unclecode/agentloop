The code I've shared is part of an app that provides services for movie fans. One feature is suggesting movies to users based on their preferences. Users swipe left or right, and we suggest new matches based on their right swipes. Here's the code that handles the swiping algorithm for movie suggestions and match-finding. Please take a look and share your understanding before I ask my request.

Hello, you beautiful people. To be honest, it's really exciting to see such growth in our user base, especially in the last few days. And to be honest, at the same time, it's a little bit scary. Because for me, this is a very interesting experience of my life. You know, if you know me or you don't, there's a little thing about me. I'm a computer scientist and software developer, coding for many years, working different projects. My background is natural language processing in my post-graduate. And an entrepreneur I set up, I built a lot of different businesses, but one of them became really good. It's KidoCode, which is basically the largest school of tech in business, providing an adaptive and personalized learning system for children. And we do have around 30,000 students. And so I did that side of my life, that you want to build something. And then I back again more into my professions in AI, computer science, coding again, and specifically did extraction and crawling because that was something that I used to do 15, 16 years ago in a very different situation, using Internet Explorer and Microsoft DLL for automations and a lot of other things. And what really motivated me, because I get frustrated that why for such a thing like turning a web page to a markdown, you have to pay a subscription fee to another business. Why even this can be a SaaS idea? A bunch of YC-backed companies forcing you to pay them. So that's the point of it. To me, it's unfair. To me, it's not unfair. Unfair is a bad term. No. Unnecessary. Well, when you don't have any options, yeah, that's good. You're just going to pay and get an endpoint URL and do that. So that was the birth of it. And then I figured out the quality is done in the way that I want it. And then the other thing that disturbed me was, as usual, people pick up the shortcut. I saw that people use live language model to give me this markdown. So I can do that in my Microsoft. I can build a simple, even Chrome extension. It takes maybe half a day to convert the website HTML, send it to OpenAI, API, even the local LLM, and then convert it and give me the markdown. So what? Is this what is going to bring change in the way we can convert what we see into a proper markdown? Is this what will bring a change in the economy and allow people to build a lot of SaaS products? To me, it's definitely not. It's not the case. Changes are not like that. These are just like temporary businesses come and pop up and for a while they make you hype and they go away. Have you ever seen, for example, the creator of the NumPy library bombard you every day with a lot of announcements and congratulations and pictures and this and that? It's not like that. That's a pure work. It's a pure science. And that is what I always wanted to have in my life as a computer scientist. It's my personal desire. And I didn't know when that was going to happen, but it seems to be happening in Crawl4AI. So that's what I wanted, to build something that really mattered, to turn into like NumPy, like SciPy, like Pandas. And that's very good news for you guys that I'm not doing this to make my daily life a living cost. It's a joke, but that's the truth. I'm doing it out of the passion, so I love it. So I'm not turning into a SaaS business and ask you to charge me, but I want to keep it free, nice, smart, elegant, in a way that no one can do even better than that. But then, need you do one more thing. You use it in your products, have fun with it, but in response, keep us motivated. Clap the hand. How you motivate your child. So it's free, it's good. You do that. You talk about it, bring it everywhere, make sure everywhere, everyone, every place, know it and use it. And that's all I need, to get this library to the hand of people, entrepreneurs, startups, that they don't pay unnecessary money. If I had the chance, I could do the same thing for many other services on the cloud. Really, I don't feel good to see a lot of things that you can do with your operating system, with a little of the Bash script, but then there is unnecessary service for that. And I am fine with any SaaS. I love to make a version of Cloud4AI available like an API that you can call it, but you know what's the problem? It's the fee that they charge. Well, these things can be very efficient, can be very minimal and nice, and very low cost. But the reality is they promote it out with a high fee. And how it works, because it works all based on this, that any entrepreneur thinking that I want to focus on my own products, I don't have time to do other things, so okay, I will pay. But at the end of the day, you come up with a product that you can't scale it. Or if you want to scale it, you need much more fundraising, and you won't get what you want to do in your life, especially if you are around 25 to 30, 35, and then it's too late. So I have this extremely personal desire at this part of my life, at this stage of my life, to build something that we call and available to everybody. So that's a little bit about me, what I'm doing this. And the second is that now when we drop the 0.5.0, this week and next few weeks, I'm going to focus heavily on creating educational content to show how is the best way of using the library. And I dropped those videos here, I dropped a short version of them in my Twitter account, but perhaps the more details here, you guys can use of them and help it. Right now we are a very small team, so if you have any questions, you can drop in the help channel, but we may not be able to fix all of them, but it will add, we focus on those high priority. But I'm pretty sure that in a few months, we're going to have more kind of dedicated collaborator and maintainer, and if anyone interested to become a full-time reach to us. And we will see. Especially, I am very selective to have really enthusiastic talent team members. A small team, but a smart team to bring it up. And I want to be very honest and clear that I want to build this Crawl4AI, which allows me to go to some of my very important field of interest. I want to build a very strong engine that can generate synthetic data in a different way that current approaches are doing it. And also, I am working on a new browser. I don't want to use Chromium, so this is a kind of really interesting project for me, which I'm going to run it in a decentralized way. I want to make it so light that everyone of you can run it on your computers at your home like a Bitcoin, and then incentivize, and then we run it. So eventually, it will become a decentralized crawler net, or sometimes we call it browser net, and then produce a service. It will be a layer, and people can use it instead of an API for one company. They can access to this cloud and use the data. So this was a long talk about my plan and projects and activities. Hopefully, it helped, and we can have fun. It's just about fun. Fun is the most important thing to me. So live long and import Crawl4AI.


 The above text is what I wanted to post in our Discord channel for new members and current members. Well, this become a kind of long text. I'm thinking also, I record the video and publish in social media about this, what is my plan for Paltreya, and that's all. So, I need you to revise it. First, in a kind of concise, shorter way that I can send it into my Discord for Discord member. That's the first issue. Then after that, we go for the longer version, which I publish as an article in my blog. And later, I also record a video for that.  If you read my message, it's very decent, it's really mean. I usually talk more than what should I do because I'm a lecturer, I'm a philosopher, but I'm a computer scientist actually. You know me, the thing is, I always want to do the maths, so that's why when I talk, I feel I have to explain more. And that brings me to lengthy conversation. You know what, it's like I have difficulty to find my minimal spanning tree in conversation. I want to stimulate people. I do it, but not optimized, not efficient. I can do exactly the same impact by lesser talk, but I'm not familiar with it. I don't know how to do that. So that's why here you can help really. My whole point is to get people attention about my decency and my work and help to build a community and in response i maintain the repository keep it always there it's strong for all of them so it's a win-win situation and i want to get people respect and recognition to me so that's why i'm building drafting this

Here's a concise, optimized revision specifically for your Discord community:

Here's the concise Discord-ready version. Let me know if you need tweaks before we proceed to the blog and video versions!

You said:
Okay, what you wrote here is fantastic, beautiful. I have just very few comments. First, the part that you say I'm expecting their recognition and respect. I think the term respect is a little bit like needy. I was just sharing with you to explain my psychology to you. So maybe a better term like I'm expecting their motivations or engagement or contribution, collaboration, or something like that, it would be better. Second point is we already released version 0.5.0. So what I want to try to tell them that is in the last few months, I spent a lot of time to make the library very efficient, memory efficient, and I believe it's very good right now. So what I'm going to do right now is spend a little bit more time on educating people, creating contents, videos, and also this is the part that I like to hear from your difficulties, challenges, so I can create content for them. So far, I heard many of them and I'm planning to create content for every one of them. Basically, we should build this little academy for Crawl4AI, which is not about teaching the Crawl4AI. It's about showing how to tackle problems that people face with Crawl4AI or even with other tools. So this is the part that I really need community support to spread the word to bring more engagement and attention to what you're doing here. And then let's go to the last part. I don't want to say beyond Crawl4AI. I want to talk about basically my future plans. So my future plans are like this. The first is by the end of this first quarter, we want to make sure we have one stable production ready version. So that's a very nice thing to do and we're very close to that. Then beyond that, I have these future plans that I'm working on them. First is I really want to cut the dependency on Chromium and I want to use my C++ skills and get dirty and write very lightweight crawler-friendly browser. A browser that is so designed for specifically doing what we are trying to do right now here and natively embedded with various small language models, which we're going to talk about. So that's the first thing that I really want to do that. The second part, as I discussed about the language model, is I want to fine-tune a series of small language models that are specifically designed to do tasks good for crawling. One, for example, is imagining a language model that is designed to just generate JavaScript code for specific action that mimic users in your crawling. So this language model is not designed to create crazy three-dimensional graphic for you, but it's designed to do this JavaScript code generation. Or a language model which is good on creating or removing noises from HTMLs to generate a better markdown. So that's the second part. The third, which is my really dream, is to use all these things, that lightweight browser that even can run on a Raspberry Pi, to launch a decentralized browser network. What I mean by that, imagine that every one of you can run a bunch of these browsers on your devices, like how we do the Bitcoin mining in a decentralized network. You get incentivized when you crawl, and then we give access to people to connect to this network and then crawl and get the data, rather than just giving all of our requests and data to one third-party company. Why don't we own this network? Why don't we build this? And that's what I'm working on. And part of it is done. And then the last one, which is my ultimate dream, is to move to what I call the data for AI. By getting all these experiences, building that decentralized network, I want to build an engine that can generate synthetic data, but very different than what we do today. Today we use language models to generate synthetic data, but that's not what I'm looking for. It's a totally different way. And I'll talk about it in its own time. Oh, and one more thing I forgot is actually that's happening before. I should have started with that one. I forgot, so you can fix this. I want to launch the web website and a web playground for all of you. So it's cool and I'm working on it. It's very retro style and you're going to love it. It allows you to first have access to coding assistance that I created, and you can ask all of your questions and get code, write code without hallucinations for crawl for AI, and also a platform that you can trial and errors and test your crawlings and then use it. Then after that, when I create that, I keep looking for very efficient ways to bring down operation costs very low. And already we are at that level. So I'm hoping to launch Crawl for AI on cloud with very low operational costs that we can give a good amount of free access to everybody. And if community is stepping in and donate and supports, we can maintain it for a larger scale. And that's another thing that I love to see what can I do. Maybe even I sponsored myself part of it. So this was the entire of the things that I want you to revise the text. Just about my future plan, make sure to adjust the order of them. So what you wrote here is very good. It's concise. I love it. And I wish I could talk like you. So please do it for me.

Asked ChatGPT

 For this I need to make it clear a little bit. I want to say I'm planning to, because I've been able to find a very good way to bring down the operational cost, and if I can do it nicely, perhaps we can build a community supported cloud that we can give fantastic or good amount of free access to this. And if the corporations are manageable, I sponsor a part of it myself, and more than that, then we get the community donations. So we will have always ready to use API for all of our applications, and we can make good use of it for whatever we build. So rephrase it in this way.

Ok, I editted a bit and I wanna dd one more section to ask for people interested join. I'm looking for people that they have two important things. They have a strong imagination and that is a passion to think and convention all to do different things. That's one engine, the power engine. And the second is they have talents. They're good at what they do and they want to be able to do it. They want to be able to do it. They're good at what they do and they want to learn and get better. 

1/ So, I look for a person that is very good experience in training and fine-tuning language model, help me for LLM parts
2/ a good person with background in the Rust and C++ to help me for building the browser, 
3/ a person with the strong skills on network and DevOps, so that can help me to build that decentralized network, especially if familiar with the browser. on network and DevOps, so that can help me to build that decentralized network, especially if familiar with decentralized databases and networks, it would be great. 
4/ And a person with a strong mathematics and data science skill. 
5/ And finally, a very well experienced software developer with a full-stack understanding and stuff

so this these are the main key people i'm looking for and beyond this everyone interested to become a part-time and your full-time collaborators contributors helping growing all must welcome and 

also i do have access i accept internship plans in my current company Kidocode and my research lab in in Singapore and also we accept interns so that they can join to Crawl4AI and help and support for the internship. So you can reach and communicate about it with us. So I want to add this at the end as well.

Crawl4ai Intro Discord
Hello everyone!

It's truly inspiring, and honestly a bit humbling, to see how rapidly our community is growing. For those of you not familiar with me, allow me to introduce myself. I'm Unclecode, a computer scientist and entrepreneur with decades of deep expertise in NLP, software engineering, and business-building. I've founded several successful ventures, including Kidocode, one of the largest online education platforms in Southeast Asia for children ages 5 to 18, with over 30,000 students.
I created Crawl4AI out of a genuine frustration with seeing simple tasks like web scraping and markdown conversion become overpriced subscription services. My ambition was never about temporary hype or trendy SaaS ventures, but about building something enduring and deeply valuable, like NumPy, SciPy, or Pandas. Something that makes your lives genuinely easier, more efficient, and accessible.

Crawl4AI will always remain free, open-source, and fueled entirely by my passion for real innovation. What motivates me most is seeing you all engaged and succeed, so your collaboration, engagement, and support in spreading the word mean the world to me.

I've spent recent months heavily optimizing Crawl4AI, enhancing both performance and memory efficiency, resulting in our latest 0.5.0 release. Now, my focus shifts towards empowering you further. I'll be producing extensive educational content, tutorials, practical guides, and videos, to directly tackle your real-world challenges. Share your struggles openly.

Here's what's immediately ahead:

Stable Release: Deliver a robust, production-ready version of Crawl4AI.

Official Website & Playground: Coming soon, a stylish retro-themed platform to provide expert coding assistance, interactive trial-and-error crawling tests, and a welcoming user experience.

Crawl4AI Cloud: I'm actively planning to offer Crawl4AI as a community-supported cloud service. Thanks to innovative methods I've developed, operational costs can be significantly reduced. If I can successfully implement this, we can provide substantial free access to all users. I'll personally sponsor part of it if the costs remain manageable, and with further community donations, we can sustain an always-available, highly effective API for all your applications.

My Bigger dreams:

A Powerful, Lightweight Browser (No Chromium!): Leveraging my C++ expertise, I'll personally craft a crawler-specialized browser, optimized to perfection, integrated with unique, task-specific language models.

Expertly Tailored Small Language Models: Fine-tuning compact models specifically for crawling tasks, whether it's seamlessly automating JavaScript actions or meticulously refining HTML to markdown.

Decentralized Browser Network (the Big Leap): Imagine a decentralized network, where you can effortlessly run lightweight browser instances from home (even on devices like a Raspberry Pi). You’ll get rewarded for crawling and collectively own the network—like a blockchain dedicated solely to data extraction.

Next-gen Synthetic Data Engine: The ultimate ambition is developing an entirely new synthetic data generation method, vastly superior to current LLM-based approaches. More on this revolutionary idea coming soon!

This journey is about leading meaningful innovation and enjoying the adventure together. I'm here to guide, support, and empower every one of you.
